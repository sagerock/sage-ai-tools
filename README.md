# sage-ai-tools

I wanted to start contributing some items that I am using on my LLM journey.

I am interested in taking information from different file types, uploading it to Pinecone Vector Database and then creating a front-end chatbot.

The front-end tool I'm using right now is based on [stephansturges/GPTflix](https://github.com/stephansturges/GPTflix). I'll just contribute any information over there.
